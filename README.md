# shop_django
Here I tried to make a model of a bookstore created with Djago. I added slugs, Custom user model, applications created with CBV and FBV, pagination,
authentication, registration. There are also comments, ratins with JavaScript, your own profile page. There is also a form for finding books on the site.
