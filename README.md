About the site:
Here I tried to make a model of a bookstore created with Django. I added slugs, Custom user model,Payment model, API, JWT authentication, 
applications created with CBV and FBV, pagination, information about all the authors, form for feedback,  
authentication, registration. There are also comments, ratings with JavaScript, your own profile page. 
There is also a form for finding books on the site.
